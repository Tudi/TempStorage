OVERVIEW
========
This program contains mostly C code, but also some of the C++ extensions. The purpuse is to open a video input file 
and demux the video and audio stream into separate files. Program parameters can be set from command line. Once
file is opened for playing, you can preview the video content on an SDL window. You can seek in the input file
content. Video file output is a stream of JPEG pictures. Audio can be dumped into a wav file.

The program relies on FFMPEG libavcodec library. Please refer to ffmpeg documentation for all supported container formats,
video, audio codecs.

For a quick help, run the program without any command line options. It should print currently supported input parameters.

LEGAL ISSUES
============
JPEG library does not have legal limitations
FFMPEG library is based on GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007
SDL is based on Simple DirectMedia Layer Copyright (C) 1997-2020 Sam Lantinga

INSTALLATION
============
You will need to compile "DecoderCore.sln" projet to generate "DecoderCore.lib" before you can build DesktopPlayer. Make sure to select build type "LibBuild"
Open DesktopPlayer.sln with Visual Studio 2019
Make sure you have x64 platform selected for build option and release version. Build the project
After build finished, it should produce : x64\Release\DesktopPlayer.exe
In order to use the exe, you will need to copy DLL files from x64\Debug\ directory : avcodec-58.dll, avutil-56.dll, postproc-55.dll, swresample-3.dll, swscale-5.dll, avformat-58.dll, avdevice-58.dll, avfilter-7.dll, SDL2.dll

USAGE
============
Running DesktopPlayer.exe without parameters, should print up to date available command line options. Some examples :
running without params should print : DesktopPlayer.exe in=filename [max_frames_to_decode=<val>] [SaveImageStream=<val>] [SaveAudioStream=<val>] [ShowFrameInfo=1]
simple play test : "./x64/release/DesktopPlayer.exe" in=TestSamples/small.mp4
show frame related info : "./x64/release/DesktopPlayer.exe" in=TestSamples/small.mp4 ShowFrameInfo=1
save video frames into jpeg files : "./x64/release/DesktopPlayer.exe" in=TestSamples/small.mp4 SaveImageStream=Frame

PLAYERCOMMANDS
============
whitespace - pause playback
's' - if video is paused, save the image as a JPEG file
'a' - start dumping audio stream to a wav file
'i' - show decoder info on console
'm' - mute audio
'+' - speed up playback. Will pause audio
'-' - slow down playback. Will pause audio
'=' - reset playback speed to normal
'left' - jump back 10 seconds in video
'right' - jump forward 10 seconds in video
'mouse click' - horizontal position in window will seek in video coresponding to duration percent

TO DO
==========
- add buffer pooling to decodercore At least check if it's worth implementing. Might have a small speed impact
- improve seek so that it waits for available frames ( with timeout ) instead fixed time amount
- improve seek to be frame precise
- check small_flashsv.avi,small_hevc.avi,small_huffyuv.avi,small_qtrle.avi,small_theora.avi decode issue
- compilation using CMAKE
- cross platform support
- more input tests. Tests more silent audios. Audio only input
- when window events occure and block rendering for some reason, make sure to pause audio play also
- make the "seek" more parametrizable. Maybe add a progress bar that supports dragging
