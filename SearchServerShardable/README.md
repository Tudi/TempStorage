Requirements
============

All test scripts require bash.

Replace <FERRARI_C> with the directory where the ferrari-c code base
 was installed.

Install dependencies
----------------

The following dependencies are required to build ferrari-c:

$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake git curl libcurl4-openssl-dev lcov

Build the 3rd party dependencies
--------------------------------

You need the 3rd party libraries to build ferrari-c and run the tests.
You only need to do do this once. Run the following commands:

$ cd <FERRARI_C_DIR>  
$ cd 3rdparty  
$ ./install.sh  

Build ferrari-c
---------------

To build ferrari-c, run the following commands:

$ cd <FERRARI_C_DIR>  
$ make  

Run ferrari-c tests
-------------------

The script setup_test_env.sh must be executed once for every terminal or shell
 where ferrari-c tests are executed.
You may want to add the 2nd line below to the initial bash configuration script
 (.bashrc, etc) if you plan to run the tests frequently.

$ cd <FERRARI_C_DIR>  
$ source ./setup_test_env.sh  
$ ./run_all_tests.sh  

Clean ferrari-c
---------------

To remove all artifacts generated by the ferrari-c build (except for the
 3rd party dependencies), run the following commands:

$ cd <FERRARI_C_DIR>  
$ make clean  

Clean the 3rd party dependencies
--------------------------------

To remove all artifacts generated by the 3rd party build for any reason,
 run the following commands:

$ cd <FERRARI_C_DIR>  
$ cd 3rdparty  
$ ./clean.sh
