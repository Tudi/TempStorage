Smart USB hub software :
 - detects when device is plugged in
 - reports device state to JAMF so that device can get unlocked ( managed devices )
 - detects if device is unplugged
 - can use an RFID card reader for auto user authentication
 
Practical usage : Audioguides for museums. You pick up a phone and if you do not hand it over at the exit, the guard can come after you.

This project had a 20 hour time budget. It is as minimal as it can get.
